  {
    question: "Who tends to love living in Fort Collins?",
    answer:
      "Fort Collins consistently attracts buyers who value walkability, outdoor access, and a community with genuine character. Old Town is a particular draw for buyers who want to live within walking distance of local restaurants, breweries, and community events. CSU's presence gives the city a college-town energy that appeals to buyers who enjoy that kind of community fabric.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is Fort Collins a good fit for buyers who want walkability and local character?",
    answer:
      "Yes — particularly near Old Town. Fort Collins' Old Town district is one of the more walkable areas on the northern Front Range, with local businesses, restaurants, and community events within easy reach. Buyers who prioritize walkability should focus their search on neighborhoods within reasonable distance of Old Town.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does Fort Collins' college-town character affect the community feel?",
    answer:
      "Colorado State University gives Fort Collins a college-town energy that shows up in the local restaurant scene, community events, and neighborhood culture. Buyers who enjoy that kind of engaged, active community tend to find it appealing. Buyers who prefer a quieter, more suburban setting may prefer neighborhoods further from the university.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does Fort Collins compare to other northern Front Range cities for lifestyle?",
    answer:
      "Fort Collins has more walkable character and Old Town identity than Greeley, and a stronger college-town feel than Loveland. It's generally more affordable than Boulder while offering some of the same outdoor access and community character that Boulder buyers value.",
  },
  {
    question: "What should lifestyle-focused buyers evaluate before choosing Fort Collins?",
    answer:
      "Buyers should evaluate proximity to Old Town, access to trails and outdoor recreation, and how the CSU presence aligns with their preferences. Fort Collins rewards buyers who understand which neighborhoods fit their daily routine rather than treating the city as a single uniform market.",
  },
